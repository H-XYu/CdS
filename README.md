# Raw data of article "Reduction reactions at the interface between CdS quantum dot and Z-type ligands driven by electron injection in the electroluminescent processes"

Raw data are generated from density functional theory (DFT) and real-time time-dependent DFT (rt-TDDFT) calculations for structures (CdS)6-XAc2 (X = Cd, Zn and Mg). These structures specifically are a ligand-passivated (CdS)6 quantum dot, with other dangling bonds passivated by pseudo-hydrogen.

X-500-DOS.spinup/spindown_projected: Total density of states (DOS) of (CdS)6-XAc2 after electron injection (at time = 500 fs).

# Methods of These Calculations
All calculations are performed using the DFT and rt-TDDFT calculations with SG15 norm-conserving pseudopotentials (NCPP) and the exchange-correlation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE), as implemented in the PWmat package. The Γ point is used for the Brillouin zone, and an energy cutoff of 45 Ry is for the plane-wave energy. The criterion of electronic convergence and the force convergence are set to be 1 × 10−6 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively. The time step is set to 0.1 fs, and a total of 500 fs of the rt-TDDFT calculations is conducted for all the screened structures.
